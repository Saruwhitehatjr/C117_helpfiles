APIs:
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software
intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. They are written to make requests to get or send some information from the server.



Types of Request:
The most common types of request methods are GET and
POST. In GET, the client (browser) sends a request to get
some data from the server. Whereas, in POST, the client
sends the data to the server.
