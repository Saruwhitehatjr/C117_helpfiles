Flask is a Python web framework, it’s a Python module
that lets you develop web applications easily.
A framework, or software framework, is a platform for
developing software applications. It provides a
foundation on which one can build programs for a specific platform.

A framework may include predefined classes and functions
that can be used to process input, manage hardware
devices, and interact with the system.
For example, a factory builds phones. The machines and
workers are included within the factory to build a phone.

A framework is like a factory and machines and workers
are the predefined functions that serve a specific task.
These are used to build phones in our case we are building
an API.

Thus, different frameworks are used for different
development purposes. In Python, Django and Flask are
the two types of frameworks available for web
development using Python.
Flask was originally developed by Armin Ronacher. He
led a group of international Python practitioners called
Poocco. It was founded in 2004.

You see here we have created an API that is used for
communicating between Python and HTML files using Flask . 
Let’s say I want to redirect the page when I am clicking a button on
the webpage. Thus, we have to create another API to
redirect it.
